Here's a simple example of some machine learning code that I wrote for an assignment for the Machine Learning Certificate program that I took at the University of Washington. 

Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees

This was one of the lab assignments that I completed as part of the UW Machine Learning Certificate Program. It demonstrates some of the benefits of random forests and gradient boosted trees by using a classification problem on a simple, overlapping, moon-shaped dataset. By comparing the model performance of various classifiers, ranging from simple linear model to ensemble tree-based models, the power of ensemble models is demonstrated. It also demonstrates the benefits of using cross validation for parameter tuning.
Some of the code (i.e. the helper function) was provided as part of the lab.
